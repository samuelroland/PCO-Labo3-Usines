# Labo 3 report - Managing concurrent access - PCO

Authors: Vit√≥ria Oliveira et Samuel Roland

## Introduction
This project consists in a sales simulation application with extractors, wholesalers and factories. They are constantly selling and/or buying resources from/to other entities. The program has a UI that shows in real time the ressources and funds of each entity.

The primary goal of this project is to effectively address problems associated to concurrent access such as the protection of shared resources. 

This report documents our strategies in implementing solutions to tackle these issues. 

## Description of software features

## Implementation Choices


### Extractors
**Competition Management in *extractor::run***  
It's necessary to acquire the instance's mutex in two steps to ensure that the current thread is the only one modifying the amount of money during the miner's payment and, later on, the modification of the stock. These instructions need protection because other threads might attempt to modify these variables simultaneously (for example, a call to trade() by another thread that could try to access money and stocks).

***Extractor::trade***  
First, it's essential to check the arguments to proceed with the transaction. A check to certify that the requested quantity is greater than 0 is made; otherwise, it would not be logical neither necessary to carry out the transaction. It is also essential to verify that the requested item matches the item sold by the extractor and that the extractor has the requested quantity.

Once this is done, we can proceed with the transaction. Therefore, we need to update the seller's stock and funds.
Since multiple threads can attempt to perform transactions simultaneously, we need to manage concurrency. Since a stock check is performed before starting the transaction, it is vital to lock a mutex before this check is made to ensure that the updated stock corresponds to the stock previously returned and that no other threads have been able to change it between these two instructions.

### Wholesales
***Wholesale::buyResources***  
To start with, it is fundamental to acquire a mutex prior to verifying the availability of the wholesale's financial resources and confirming the feasibility of the trade through a call to the seller's trade function. This is necessary to prevent a potential interference by another thread that may alter the wholesale's finances or the seller's inventory. Once this is done, we can proceed and update the wholesale's funds and inventory,  after which the mutex can be released. 

***Wholesale::trade()***  
Similar to Extractor::trade, except for the conditions to proceed with the trade. It is necessary to check if the requested quantity is strictly positive or if this quantity for the wanted item is available in stock.


### Termination 
In order to ensure a proper termination of the simulation, we've declared a boolean variable called *stopRequest* in the file *Utils.cpp* that serves as signal to indicate if a request to end the simulation has been made. 
This variable is initially set to false and is set to true if a call to *Utils::endService()* is made (when the window is closed).

To take this in account elsewhere in the project, we've added a while loop that checks if *stopRequest* is true in all run functions for each Seller subclass.    

## Tests
To avoid needing to setup a Qt UI interface just to do unit tests, we decided to disable any usage of the `interface` attribute so we don't call `setInterface`. (Therefore the attribute `interface` is `NULLPTR` in tests). We created a macro `NTEST` used like `NTEST(interface...)` that doesn't run the given instruction in case the `GTEST` variable has been defined. This is kind of a "headless" mode.

To run unit test, we setup a each entity with fakes entities requesting trades and accepted trades against it so we can validate the concurrency protections are effective.

To run end to end test, we create a `Utils` object and call its `run` method to start and `externalEndService` method to end.
